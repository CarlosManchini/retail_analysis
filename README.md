# Project Overview


Graphical results can be viewed in the file [Retail_Analysis.html](Retail_Analysis.html).

This repository hosts predictive models and optimization strategies aimed at enhancing various aspects of retail operations:

## Customer Segmentation

- **Objective:** Delve deep into customer ordering behavior to identify distinct segments.
- **Key Factors:** Order frequency, time of day, and days since the last order.
- **Goal:** Tailor marketing strategies more effectively to meet customers' needs in a personalized and efficient manner.

## Inventory Management

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to accurately estimate inventory levels for individual products.
- **Goal:** Optimize stock levels. Reduce waste. Ensure availability of popular items.

The application will employ machine learning techniques like clustering for pattern identification and random forest for accurate predictions, facilitating a more in-depth, customized analysis to further optimize internal processes.
