# Project Overview

Explore comprehensive results in the notebook file [Retail_Analysis.ipynb](Retail_Analysis.ipynb).

This repository hosts an in-depth analysis of Online Retail, focusing on predictive models and optimization strategies aimed at enhancing various aspects of retail operations:

## Customer Segmentation

- **Objective:** Dive into customer ordering behavior to identify distinct segments.
- **Key Factors:** Order frequency, time of day, and days since the last order.
- **Goal:** Tailor marketing strategies more effectively to meet customers' needs in a personalized and efficient manner.

## Inventory Management

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to accurately estimate inventory levels for individual products.
- **Goal:** Optimize stock levels, reduce waste, and ensure availability of popular items.

The application employs machine learning techniques like clustering for pattern identification and random forest for accurate predictions, facilitating a more in-depth, customized analysis to further optimize internal processes.
